# React-Project-Assignment
This project is a **React-based application** that includes interactive components and state management features as per the assignment requirements.

## Key features:
1. **Counter Component**:-
    
  -> Users can increment, decrement, and reset the counter.
  
  -> The background color changes dynamically based on the count value.
  
  -> Implemented using the useState hook for state management.

2. **User Form Data**:-
   
  -> Users can input and submit form data, which is saved in local storage.
  
  -> Existing user data can be modified without creating a new user ID.
  
  -> Redux is used for efficient state management of user data.
  
  -> Users receive an alert before closing the browser if there are unsaved changes.

3. **Rich TextEditor**:-
   
  -> Displays previously saved data or an empty values in editor if no data exists.
  
  -> Users can format and edit text within the editor.
  
  -> Implemented using Draft.js for rich text editing capabilities.

This project demonstrates the use of **React hooks, Redux for state management, and Draft.js for text formatting**, ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
